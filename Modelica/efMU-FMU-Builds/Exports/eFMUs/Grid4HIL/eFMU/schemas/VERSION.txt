This file lists the versions of the Container Manifest schema.
Each version gets an entry of the form:
- Version: version number in semantic version format consisting of <major>.<minor>.<patch>
- Revision: SHA1 ID hash of GIT commit
- Description: May consist of multiple lines.
The entries should be separated by an empty line.

The recent version number must become the fixed value of the "version" attribute of the Content element of the schema file.
On the other hand, the "eFMUContainerBuilder" writes the supported version number to that attribute.
Hence, the version number can be used for multiple purposes:
- For each Manifest file, the considered version of the schema is stored.
- The validation of the Manifest file can also check wether the file fits to the schema.
