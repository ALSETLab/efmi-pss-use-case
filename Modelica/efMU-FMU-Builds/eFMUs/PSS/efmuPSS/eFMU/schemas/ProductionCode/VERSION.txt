This file lists the versions of the ProductionCode schema.
Each version gets an entry of the form:
- Version: version number in semantic version format consisting of <major>.<minor>.<patch>
- Revision: SHA1 ID hash of GIT commit
- Description: May consist of multiple lines.
The entries should be separated by an empty line.

The recent version number must become the fixed value of the "version" attribute of the Manifest element of the schema file.
On the other hand, the "eFMUProdCodeDescriptionCreator" writes the supported version number to that attribute.
Hence, the version number can be used for multiple purposes:
- For each Manifest file, the considered version of the schema is stored.
- The validation of the generated Manifest file also checks wether the file fits to the schema.
  If not, it produces an error message like: "Validation failed: The value of the 'version' attribute does not equal its fixed value."

Removed efmiDescriptionFiles.xsd and efmiProperties.xsd (the latter was only used for elements of the former).
The rationale is:
  (1) We have no examples with <DescriptionFiles> and <DescriptionFile> elements in Production Code manifests in the
      eFMI crosschecks.
  (2) When adding AUTOSAR Builder production code with *.arxml files, which according to the old specification have
      to be listed as <DescriptionFile>, it turned out that the manifest can have only one, either a <CodeFiles> or
      a <DescriptionFiles>. This design is broken, since e.g., the AUTOSAR Builder production code containers have
      both of course, C source code and *.arxml files.
  (3) The old <DescriptionFiles> element was part of the <CodeContainer>. But that one clearly is only about C
      source code.
  (4) Fixing these issues would require a proper redesign without having any test cases yet. And generating/filling
      potential <DescriptionFile> with meaningful properties is questionable; what are these supposed to be?
      Everything regarding the *.arxml is well-defined by AUTOSAR; there is no need to repeat what is in these files
      (they are of course listed in the <Files> section with role="other").
      It would also take considerable time before AUTOSAR Builder -- or any other tool -- could produce AND leverage
      on <DescriptionFile> elements; there is no need to generate something nobody uses.
  (5) The new XSD Schema and specification is 100% backwards compatible as long as <DescriptionFiles> are not used.
      According to (1), nobody ever used it.
  (6) Considering (2), the old design is obviously broken and not useable; and considering (5) removing
      <DescriptionFiles> does no harm to our current tooling.
  (7) The old design is archived in the '2022-03-03-Production-Code-XSD-DescriptionFiles-backup' git branch.
