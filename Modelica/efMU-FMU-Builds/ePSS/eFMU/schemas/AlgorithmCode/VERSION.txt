This file lists the versions of the AlgorithmCode schema.
Each version gets an entry of the form:
- Version: version number in semantic version format consisting of <major>.<minor>.<patch>
- Revision: SHA1 ID hash of GIT commit
- Description: May consist of multiple lines.
The entries should be separated by an empty line.

Version: 0.1
Revision: e0387d7d28a1a400e329dbeda49a7b6279e9f319
Description:
- Renamed algorithm code manifest XSD
- Manifest has "id" attribute which is UUID
- Adapted Algorithm code manifest XSDs
  - attributes of "Manifest" root element adapted to Production code
  - Use ManifestReference.xsd to refer to origin manifest
  - Added "id" for types (only SimpleType, because StructuredType not used) and variables.
    A Variable can refer to a type from its "VariableType".
	(This was added to create an EFMU container with both algorithm and production code, where a production code manifest's variable refers to an algorithm code manifest's variable.
	 We suggest to add the concept of Ids and RefIds of the production code schema to the algorithm code schema also.)
