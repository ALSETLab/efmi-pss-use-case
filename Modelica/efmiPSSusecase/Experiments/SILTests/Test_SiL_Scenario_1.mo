          <b>Warning:</b> All checks of this test are <u><i>disabled</i></u> by
          default (which can be changed if desired). All meaningful SiL tests of
          Software Production Engineering generated production codes are covered

          they cover.

          The purpose of this test is to provide an easy means to play with…
          <ul>
            <li>…co-simulation of different production codes in a single
            simulation run and compare their results using the
            <code>__cosimulation_results</code> array of the eFMU co-simulation
            stub (<code>eBlock</code>)</li>
            <li>…modifications of tuneable parameters</li>
            <li>…reinitializion and recalibration behavior by activating it at
            the <code>eBlock</code> and connecting respective tuning and
            reinitialization inputs</li>
            <li>…any other test setup for which the reference trajectories
            can be reused (could be just for plotting, whereas
            <code>eBlock</code> inputs are reconnected to something else using
            Modelica's selective model extension to deselect the default
            connection to the reference trajectories)</li>
          </ul>

          renamed</b>.
