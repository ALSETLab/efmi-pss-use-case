*************************************************************************** eFMI Compliance Checker: 

Checking if the given file exists and is an eFMU archive
         The provided file is a valid 'fmu' archive


Extracting the fmu archive  eFMU-cc.fmu
         The [eFMU] folder is correctly contained in the fmu archive
         [eFMU] folder extracted correctly

Checking the eFMU container architecture
         The schemas folder is correctly contained in the  C:\Users\vanfr\Documents\Github\efmi-pss-use-case\Modelica\work\CHILTest\tmp\eFMU
         The __content.xml is correctly located in the C:\Users\vanfr\Documents\Github\efmi-pss-use-case\Modelica\work\CHILTest\tmp\eFMU

Parsing the __content.xml file
         __content.xml was parsed correctly

Running the consistency check for all model representations in the __content.xml file
   - The AlgorithmCode model representation
         The representation id matches the id in the manifest
         The representation checksum matches the calculated checksum of the manifest
         The manifest.xml manifest file was correctly validated against the relevant schema file
         The manifest.xml manifest file does not contain any manifest references

   - The ProductionCode model representation
         The representation id matches the id in the manifest
         The representation checksum matches the calculated checksum of the manifest
         The manifest.xml manifest file was correctly validated against the relevant schema file
         All manifest references in the manifest.xml manifest file are valid

   - The ProductionCode model representation
         The representation id matches the id in the manifest
         The representation checksum matches the calculated checksum of the manifest
         The manifest.xml manifest file was correctly validated against the relevant schema file
         All manifest references in the manifest.xml manifest file are valid

   - The BinaryCode model representation
         The representation id matches the id in the manifest
         The representation checksum matches the calculated checksum of the manifest
         The manifest.xml manifest file was correctly validated against the relevant schema file
         All manifest references in the manifest.xml manifest file are valid

   - The BinaryCode model representation
         The representation id matches the id in the manifest
         The representation checksum matches the calculated checksum of the manifest
         The manifest.xml manifest file was correctly validated against the relevant schema file
         All manifest references in the manifest.xml manifest file are valid

   - The BinaryCode model representation
         The representation id matches the id in the manifest
         The representation checksum matches the calculated checksum of the manifest
         The manifest.xml manifest file was correctly validated against the relevant schema file
         All manifest references in the manifest.xml manifest file are valid

   - The BinaryCode model representation
         The representation id matches the id in the manifest
         The representation checksum matches the calculated checksum of the manifest
         The manifest.xml manifest file was correctly validated against the relevant schema file
         All manifest references in the manifest.xml manifest file are valid

Other consistency checks
         All variables in the AlgorithmCode manifest are consistent with the variables in the  manifest

Validating the __content.xml file against the efmiContainerManifest.xsd schema file
         The __content.xml file was validated correctly against the efmiContainerManifest.xsd schema file

Reading all 'alg' files from the manifest.xml file and checking if these files exist in the AlgorithmCode folder
         The block.alg file is listed in the manifest.xml file
         block.alg exists in the C:\Users\vanfr\Documents\Github\efmi-pss-use-case\Modelica\work\CHILTest\tmp\eFMU\ACode_Dymola directory

Parsing the block.alg file 

Validating all variables:

  All model variables in the manifest file are declared in the Algorithm Code file and vice versa
  All model variables types and blockCausalities in the manifest file match the types and causalities in the Algorithm Code file

functions

The Reinitialize function

   All variables of expressions are declared in the Algorithm code block
   Function expressions do not contain any errors

The Recalibrate function

   All variables of expressions are declared in the Algorithm code block
   Function expressions do not contain any errors

The Startup function

   All variables of expressions are declared in the Algorithm code block
   Function expressions do not contain any errors

The DoStep function

Errors:
