Other consistency checks
         All variables in the AlgorithmCode manifest are consistent with the variables in the  manifest

Validating the __content.xml file against the efmiContainerManifest.xsd schema file
         The __content.xml file was validated correctly against the efmiContainerManifest.xsd schema file

Reading all 'alg' files from the manifest.xml file and checking if these files exist in the AlgorithmCode folder
         The block.alg file is listed in the manifest.xml file
         block.alg exists in the C:\Users\CBR5.DSONE\Documents\Dymola\GridForHILTesting\tmp\eFMU\ACode_Dymola directory

Parsing the block.alg file 

Validating all variables:

  All model variables in the manifest file are declared in the Algorithm Code file and vice versa
  All model variables types and blockCausalities in the manifest file match the types and causalities in the Algorithm Code file
